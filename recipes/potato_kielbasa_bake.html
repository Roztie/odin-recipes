  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, 
    hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look 
    at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something 
    new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation 
    to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring 
    and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had 
    ordered every day for the past two years.</p>
